# CO2project

A CO2 sensor designed to keep schools open during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Description 

This is a guide to build a CO2 sensor for classrooms and other uses. The schematic is attached, a guide on how to build/hook up the CO2 sensor with an Aurdino Uno, along with the Python 3 code used to analyze, plot, and sort the data. There are two versions of the code, one which sorts out outliers and one that does not. 

> The schematic includes an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, a CO2 sensor, an SD card reader/writer, and a real-time-clock (RTC).
